# DRAMA Syntax Highlighter
## Overview
This is a DRAMA syntax highlighter for Sublime Text 3. The DRAMA language created by the teachers at KU Leuven is based on assembly. It was designed for learning assembly. There was no syntax highlighting available so I created my own. The syntax coding isn't 100% correct since it's a bit different than most languages. My syntax coding was created with the monokai color scheme in mind, but will look fine with most color schemes.

## Installation
**Manual:** In linux, execute the following commands: 

```
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/
git clone https://github.com/woutdp/DRAMASyntax.git
```

If you're in Windows try to find sublime-text-3/Packages/ folder and download as ZIP and extract into this. This should also do the trick.

**Package Control:** This package will be added to package control in a couple of weeks/days. The developers of package control need to review it first.

## Usage
After installing, open up a DRAMA file in Sublime and go to Tools->Syntax and select DRAMA. You should now see the text highlighted in color.
