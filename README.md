# DRAMA Syntax Highlighter
## Overview
This is a DRAMA syntax highlighter for Sublime Text 3. The DRAMA language created by the teachers at KU Leuven is based on assembly. It was designed for learning assembly. There was no syntax highlighting available so I created my own. The syntax coding isn't 100% correct since it's a bit different than most languages. My syntax coding was created with the monokai color scheme in mind, but will look fine with most color schemes.

## Installation
**Package control**: You can install DRAMASyntax with [package control](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel).  
This is the recommended way. **It could be that the package isn't online yet!**

**Manual:** In linux, execute the following commands: 

```
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/
git clone https://github.com/woutdp/DRAMASyntax.git
```
