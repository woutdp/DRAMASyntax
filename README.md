# A DRAMA syntax highlighter for Sublime Text 3
This is a DRAMA syntax highlighter for Sublime Text 3. The DRAMA language created by the teachers at KU Leuven is based on assembly. It is designed for learning assembly. There was no syntax highlighting available so I created my own for my text editor of choice: Sublime Text 3. The syntax coding isn't 100% correct since it's a bit different than most languages. My syntax coding was created with the monokai color scheme, but will look fine with most color schemes.
