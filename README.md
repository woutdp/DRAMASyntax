# DRAMA Syntax Highlighter
## Overview
This is a DRAMA syntax highlighter for Sublime Text 3 and 2. The DRAMA language was created by the teachers at KU Leuven. It was designed for learning assembly.

There was no syntax highlighting available so I created my own. The syntax coding isn't 100% correct since it's a bit different than most languages. The syntax coding was created with the monokai color scheme in mind, but will look fine with most color schemes.

## Installation
**Package Control:** You can install this through [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/). You will automatically get the latest patches.

## Usage
After installing, open up a DRAMA file in Sublime and go to View->Syntax and select DRAMA. You should now see the text highlighted in color.
